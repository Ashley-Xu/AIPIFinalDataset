**Executive Summary (with motivation and potential applications)**

I am trying to solve the mystery of how people are finding love on online dating apps. 

Potential applications: Professions can matter for both men and women, what are some of the most popular professions that get the greatest number of matches for men vs for women.  

The opening line is very important for successful matches as well. What are some of the key characteristics that frequently appear in opening lines that resulted in successful matches? What about the length of the opening line? 

**Description of data**
The dataset contains anonymized data extracted and transformed from Tinder conversations. The data includes various attributes related to the conversations between users, such as:

- `_id`: A unique identifier for each conversation entry.
- `match_id`: A unique identifier for each match.
- `message`: The content of the message sent in the conversation.
- `gender`: The gender of the user who sent the message (M for male, F for female).
- `Opener`: A numerical value indicating the position of the message in the conversation (1 for the first message, 2 for the second, etc.).
- `Basic Opener`: A boolean value indicating whether the message is a basic opener (True or False).
- `Conv Length`: The length of the conversation in terms of the number of messages exchanged.
- `Gif Opener`: A boolean value indicating whether the message contains a GIF (True or False).
- `question`: A boolean value indicating whether the message contains a question (True or False).
- `Pickup Line`: A boolean value indicating whether the message is a pickup line (True or False).

The dataset provides insights into the dynamics of Tinder conversations, including the types of openers used, the length of conversations, and the success rates of different message types. This data can be used to analyze patterns and trends in online dating interactions, helping to identify factors that contribute to successful matches.



**Power analysis results**

Set significance level to 0.05, power to 80%, and the sample size of the data that I was given permission to make open source is on 1000 users’ profiles. We want to see given our data (sample size), what the effect size (d) is. I calculated the effect size to be 0.0885, which is fairly small effect size given the sample size of 1000, power of 80% and significance level to 0.05. This means that, even if there is a small difference between the two groups of samples, we will be able to detect it.  

**Exploratory data analysis**
The analysis included the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loaded the dataset from the CSV file and performed initial data cleaning. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing any duplicates.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated basic descriptive statistics for the dataset, such as mean, median for numerical columns. Also, provided frequency counts for categorical columns.

3. **Data Visualization**: Created various visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. This included:
   - Histograms and box plots for numerical features like conversation length.
   - Bar charts for categorical features like gender and opener type.
   - Word clouds to visualize the most common words used in successful opening lines.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Conducted a correlation analysis to identify any significant relationships between different features. This included calculating correlation coefficients and visualizing the correlations using heatmaps.

5. **Gender-based Analysis**: Compared the conversation patterns and success rates between different genders. This included visualizing the differences and performing hypothesis tests to identify any statistically significant differences.

8. **Opener Type Analysis**: Examined the effectiveness of different types of openers (e.g., basic opener, gif opener, pickup line) in initiating successful conversations. This involved calculating success rates for each opener type and visualizing the results.

Overall, the EDA provided valuable insights into the factors that contribute to successful matches on Tinder, including the importance of the opening line, the impact of conversation length, and the differences in conversation patterns between genders.
